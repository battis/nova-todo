<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48892071/98032424-ffb79300-1de1-11eb-8d3c-b016df4ffde6.png" width="200" alt="TODO Extension Logo">

Displays tags, such as TODO and FIXME, within a sidebar tree view in Panic's macOS code editor, Nova.

## Installing

Enable the extension in the extension library within Nova.

## Configuration

### Workspace Configuration
To ignore files or directories or include additional tags for a specific workspace, go to the project settings.

### Global Configuration
For global ignore settings, go to the extension within the extension library and click on "Preferences".

## Known Issues

* Updates to preferences are not always saved. **As a temporary workaround, click into another text box in the preferences window to trigger the save event, prior to clicking "Done". This forces the input to lose focus and save.**
* The sidebar currently displays tags that occur anywhere within a file. Future releases will search only within comments.

## Future Features

* Tag highlighting within the code.
