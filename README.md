<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48892071/101074075-54c7ff80-356e-11eb-86d5-df8cd793ecce.png" width="200" alt="TODO Extension Logo">

Displays tags, such as TODO and FIXME, within a sidebar tree view in Panic's macOS code editor, Nova.

## Installing

Enable the extension in the extension library within Nova.

## Configuration

### Workspace Configuration
To ignore files or directories or include additional tags for a specific workspace, go to the project settings.

### Global Configuration
For global ignore settings, go to the extension within the extension library and click on "Preferences".

## Known Issues

* Updates to preferences are not always saved. **As a temporary workaround, click into another text box in the preferences window to trigger the save event, prior to clicking "Done". This forces the input to lose focus and save.** This issue should be fixed in a future Nova update.

## Planned Future Features

* Tag highlighting within the code.
* Tag notification in the sidebar icon.
